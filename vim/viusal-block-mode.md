# Visual Block Mode

To enter visual block mode type `ctrl-v`.  Today I needed this to make a a bulleted list in a markdown file and I followed these steps:

1) Put cursor on first line of what I wanted to turn into a list
2) Type `ctrl-v`
3) Type `j` to move down to the last line of the list
4) Type `I` to go into insert mode.  The selection will look lost but don'p worry
4) Type `-` and then `esc` twice
